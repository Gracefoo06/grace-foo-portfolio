      <h2>What is FreshFare?</h2>
      <p class="middle-text">FreshFare is a delivery app, where home chefs can easily set up their own online
        stores on this app. Users will be able to order/pre-order meals from these home chefs and have it
        delivered to them with seamless delivery, and the home chefs will have an easy platform they can use to
        be able to promote their own home businesses.

      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p class="middle-text"> I plan to make a delivery app, where people can order home cooked from home chefs, to be
        delivered to
        them seamlessly without any conversation or need to meet up physically to pick up food, which reduces
        the spread of covid and give business to home chefs.</p>

      <p class="middle-text"> I first thought of this idea when covid-19 first started. My mother had a couple of
        friends who were in the
        food and beverage industry. However, due to the lockdown, many of them lost their jobs. This is
        supported by an article from CNBC stating that “ vast majority of the industry’s layoffs were in food
        service, where the government said 5.5 million chefs, waiters and cashiers lost jobs.” (Franck, 2020) .
        Those chefs tried to make money by selling food they had cooked in their own homes, however, the only
        ways they could promote their business was through WhatsApp and their own personal social media, but
        at times still struggled to find potential buyers, and were struggling to continue taking care of their
        families. Additionally, I also realized that due to covid-19, some people may not be with their families, and
        may miss eating home-cooked food. Thus, I thought of an idea that could help these home chefs, by having
        a dedicated platform where users who want to buy homemade food, can easily buy food from these home
        chefs, to be delivered to their houses without much contact with others.
      </p>

      <p class="middle-text">If you would like to see the full documentation/proposal done by me, click the buttons
        on the left, or
        click <a href="freshfare/DUX_Assg1_P03_GraceFoo (2).pdf">here</a> as I will show a summarised version of my
        documentation</p>
      </p>
      <h2>Why retain FreshFare in a post covid world?</h2>
      <p class="middle-text">The benefits of retaining this app post covid today are that there are still home chefs who
        want to
        continue selling their food and people who want to buy home-cooked food. As seen from an article from
        Mothership, Cassandra Xu, who is a housewife and went on to being a home chef, and later created a
        telegram group to help promote and sell other home chefs food named cook for more, which proves that
        multiple are still trying to make a business as a home chef</p>

      <img src="freshfare/fr-covid1.png" width="710" height="390">
      <p class="middle-text">By keeping up FreshFare in a post covid world, we can help these home chefs promote
        themselves on a
        dedicated platform without worrying much about delivery, or contacting people, as the delivery will be
        seamless without much interaction with the customer.
      </p>

      <p class="middle-text">With 1 in 5 Singaporeans working more than 11 hours a day and only 22% cooking at home
        daily, there's a growing demand for convenient, home-cooked meals, since they may not have time to cook at home.
        FreshFare aims to address this need with an app connecting home chefs with busy individuals. By streamlining the
        process of setting up a profile and offering seamless delivery, FreshFare provides a solution for both home
        chefs looking to sell their dishes and busy consumers craving homemade food. The app targets a post-COVID market
        where there's still a demand for home-cooked meals, as evidenced by the ongoing activity in the telegram group
        shown above
      </p>
      <h2>Core Objectives</h2>


      <ul class="middle-text">
        <li>A user who wants to set up an online store selling food, and for it to be easily delivered to others.</li>
        <li>A user who can buy home-cooked food on a platform easily without much hassle.</li>
      </ul>


      <h1>Compeitive anaylysis</h1>
      <img src="freshfare/fr-ca.png" width="590" height="400">
      <p class="middle-text"> I performed a competitive analysis of apps or websites similar to what I had in mind, I did a
        competitive analysis of Carousell, Facebook Market Place and Deliveroo
        , which can all be seen in
        detail in the full proposal</p>

      <h1>Mobile app functions</h1>
      <h2>1. Setting up your own “store” easily as a home chef</h2>
      <img src="freshfare/fr-set.png" width="590" height="400">
      <p class="middle-text">Home chefs can easily set up their stores on the app by registering up as a chef, after
        that they can click on "setting up kitchen" to start setting up their shop, either by opening their online
        delivery for the day, setting up menu's, editing their description etc. A step by step guide of me breaking down
        the function can be seen in the demo video above or in the full proposal/document. </p>


      <h2>2. Being able to browse and order a meal
      </h2>
      <img src="freshfare/fr-order.png" width="730" height="390">
      <p class="middle-text">Users can order meals, whether it be MTO or preorder for example users can. From the image
        above, it is an example of a user ordering a chicken rice, where they can adjust the quantity, adjust if they
        don't want chili or even add it to "quick order" which will be discused later. A step by step guide of me
        breaking down the function can be seen in the demo video above or in the full proposal/document. </p>

      <h2>3. Favourites
      </h2>
      <img src="freshfare/fr-fav.png" width="290" height="390">
      <p class="middle-text">Users can keep their favourite stores in a list which can be accessed by clicking the heart
        button in the ordering page or accessed through the hamburger menu. </p>

      <h2>4. Add, delete, and pick and switch the payment
      </h2>
      <img src="freshfare/fr-card.png" width="700" height="430">
      <p class="middle-text">With this function, you are able to add new payment options, pick which payment option you
        want to use, and delete payment options
      </p>

      <h2>5. Add Reviews
      </h2>
      <img src="freshfare/fr-review.png" width="700" height="430">
      <p class="middle-text">For users to trust buying from home chefs, there should be a way to see reviews and
        feedback on
        their profiles. You can see reviews on profiles by clicking the review tab. Home chefs can also take the
        reviews as feedback on what they can improve on as well

      </p>
      <p class="middle-text">You are only allowed to review a shop after successfully ordering a meal from them, to keep
        it fair. To
        leave a review, open the hamburger bar and click on the feedback/review</p>

      <h1>Smartwatch functions
      </h1>
      <h2>1. Quick orders</h2>
      <img src="freshfare/fr-qo.png" width="280" height="400">
      <p class="middle-text">Since the smartwatch is small and mostly used for convenience I decided to make a function
        that
        can easily order your food in 4 taps.
        How to set an easy order for your smartwatch?
        As shown earlier, for made-to-order dishes, after editing your meal and adjusting a few things
        like quantity, you can save this order to quick order
      </p>

      <h2>2. Vibration to notify user’s
      </h2>
      <img src="freshfare/fr-vibe.png" width="220" height="260">
      <p class="middle-text">The smartwatch will vibrate on the user’s wrist to help notify the user that the food has
        arrived</p>

      <h2>3. Favourite
      </h2>
      <img src="freshfare/fr-3.1.png" width="290" height="320">
      <img src="freshfare/fr-3.2.png" width="180" height="320">
      <p class="middle-text">Here you can look at your favourite stores from the favourite list, and order a meal from
        it
        Favorite shows all your favorite stores that you have put in this list. The list can be adjusted in the mobile
        version. For the smartwatch, you can tap and open the favorites list and put a order. You can find your
        favourite in the hamburger bar</p>

      <h2>4. Being able to quickly order past orders you have ordered
      </h2>
      <img src="freshfare/fr-4.1.png" width="290" height="340">
      <img src="freshfare/fr-4.2.png" width="270" height="340">
      <p class="middle-text">If you are in a rush and want to order the exact same thing you ordered in the past, you
        can order
        it quickly by going into history</p>
      <p class="middle-text">When you click on history it shows your past orders, in this instance its just one bowl of
        prawn noodles,
        you can click on the order and it will immediately show you the confirm order page. Click on order up and
        the order is complete</p>


      <h1>Persona</h1>
      <p class="middle-text">For this project, I decided to interview two people to represent the two different users
        who will use the
        app.
        One named Julie Yee, who lost her job as a cooking teacher during covid, who then turned to being a home
        chef to support her family during those tough times and the second person being Joshua Foo, a digital payment
        business project manager who works at food
        panda and also frequently uses the app as well</p>
      <h2>Julie Yee</h2>

      <h2>Low Fidelity sketch for Smart Watch</h2>

      <h2>Colour palette and reasoning</h2>
      <img src="freshfare/fr-color.png" width="450" height="140">
      <p class="middle-text">I decided to use this color palette as Red and yellow are usually associated with food and or chiefs as it
                               evokes the tastebuds and stimulates people’s appetite. The two colors are also very effective in grabbing
                               attention due to their bright colors.</p>
