      <h2>What is RoBeats?</h2>
      <img src="robeats/intro.jpg" width="500" height="300">
      <p class="middle-text">
        Created on 17 March 2018, Robeats is a MMORPG rhythm game, created by RoBeatsDev, on the website roblox. Its
        main gameplay feature is playing through a song, where you have to press the notes on time on the 4 button lane
        and to keep you accuracy and combo high.
      </p>
      <p class="middle-text">
        It is both a single player game and a multiplayer game ( letting 4 players play together at a time ). You can
        play from original songs to songs from games to Vocaloid and other popular songs on the internet.
        You can also explore and dance around the lobby and interact with npc’s.

      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p class="middle-text">Me and my friends have been a fan of rhythm games for a while thus, we tried out the game
        together and we quite enjoy it, however over time we realize there are some issues with controls due to our
        keyboards, and some of them wish to have a dedicated controller for this game thus I decided to make a
        controller that makes the game easier to play and control, to fix those issues. </p>

      <p class="middle-text">If you would like to see the full documentation and proposal done by me, click the buttons
        on the left, or
        click <a href="robeats/EXD_Assg1_GraceFoo (3).pdf">here</a>, as I will show a summarised version of my
        documentation/proposal.</p>
      </p>

      <h2>Core Objectives</h2>
      <ul class="middle-text">
        <li>A user who can use a controller where the buttons are easier to see and press.</li>
        <li>A use. who can enjoy a cool looking controller for the game they like ( which is robeats )</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Target Audience</h1>
      <p class="middle-text">The target audience is for dedicated Robeats players who want a controller dedicated to
        playing robeats that improves on the user experience.</p>
      <h1>Issues with Robeats</h1>
      <img src="robeats/issues.png" width="640" height="380">
      <p class="middle-text">I did research into issues with robeats to see if I could learn or improve anything from,
        by looking into what fans of the game has to say about the negatives about the game.
        it.</p>

      <h1>Research Into Makey Makey</h1>
      <img src="robeats/makey.png" width="750" height="390">
      <p class="middle-text"> I did research into Makey Makey so I can learn better about the product and could use that
        knowledge to better degree.</p>


      <h1>Compeitive anaylysis</h1>
      <img src="robeats/rb-ca.png" width="750" height="390">
      <p class="middle-text"> I performed a competitive analysis of rhythm game controllers similar to robeats gameplay
        layout and what I had in mind, I did a analysis on Divaller,
        I Pega,
        Gamo 2 Faucetwo Sound Vortex Controller,
        Pocket SDVX Pico v5,
        Synths lab solo Macropad,
        Phoenix Wan IIDX cntroller,

        which can all be seen in
        detail in the full proposal</p>
      <h2>Table of Summary of our findings( the full table can be seen in the proposal )</h2>

      <h1>Persona</h1>
      <img src="robeats/persona.png" width="620" height="460">
      <p class="middle-text"> The persona’s named, often plays robeats and other rhythm games during their free time
        thus I decided to interview them</p>

      <img src="robeats/map.png" width="640" height="360">

      <h1>Design Rationale</h1>
      <img src="robeats/rb-dr.png" width="520" height="460">
      <p class="middle-text">I wanted my controller to look like a dj set, where the play buttons look like a record so
        it looks like your playing a song for the roblox avatar to dance too. ( for explanation, the avatar will start
        dancing if you are playing well in the game).</p>
      <p class="middle-text"> Additionally since there are a DJ character that queues in the next track you will play in
        the game, I wanted the controller to look like it may have belonged to the character in question</p>
      <h1>Visual Research</h1>
      <img src="robeats/visualresearch.png" width="590" height="20">
      <h1>Sketches</h1>
      <p class="middle-text">I started to model out how the rough controller would look like and started sketching ideas
        based on it, the other sketches can be seen in detail in the documentation/proposal. </p>
      <img src="robeats/rb-sketch.png" width="780" height="390">

      <h1>Features</h1>
      <h2>Adding brightly colored buttons</h2>
      <img src="robeats/rb-button.png" width="310" height="180">
      <p class="middle-text">
        In rhythm games like Robeats, fast-paced gameplay and hand-eye coordination are key thus, visibility of buttons
        is crucial as players risk losing their combo and scores if they miss a press. Most Robeats players, like my
        persona, use keyboards that are often fully grey or black, making buttons less eye-catching and reducing
        visibility.
      </p>
      <p class="middle-text">To increase visibility, I opted for a bright color—white. Studies suggest that higher
        luminosity enhances contrast, making objects stand out more. This helps players quickly spot buttons during
        fast-paced gameplay, improving navigation efficiency.</p>
      <p class="middle-text"> Also looking from my research on controllers, an advantage that some controllers shared
        like the Divaller was that the buttons could light up making it easier to see, since I was not able to implement
        lights in my controller, this was the next best thing I could implement.</p>
      <p class="middle-text"> Additionally, since my controller is mostly grey and dark in color, the white buttons
        contrast well against the background of the controller housing to make it easier to distinguish between the
        buttons, reducing confusion during gameplay.</p>
      <p class="middle-text"></p>

      <h2>Adjusting the layout of the buttons</h2>

      <p class="middle-text">My persona mentioned to me that when they play robeats for long periods of time, their
        hands tend to cram because of the layout of their keyboard. </p>
      <p class="middle-text">If they adjust the key binds to increase the distance between the buttons to try to make it
        more comfortable for the long run, it just makes it more difficult to keep up with the game, as players may
        realize they have to look over a larger area because of this change and with small monotone colored keys,
        players will have a harder time seeing where the key binds are.</p>
      <p class="middle-text">Most robeats players including her uses key binds that have a gap in the middle but the two
        keys side to side</p>
      <img src="robeats/rb-2.1.png" width="480" height="390">
      <p class="middle-text">I realized that playing with these keybinds on the keyboard is not very ergonomic, as well
        as research showing that modern day keyboard layouts QWERTY is not ergonomic, stating“The QWERTY keyboard was
        not designed to be ergonomic. It has a high same-finger ratio, which increases strain. If you type constantly on
        the QWERTY keyboard, your chances of developing carpal tunnel syndrome are higher than with a more ergonomic
        layout.”</p>
      <p class="middle-text">Therefore for my controller I decided to take inspiration from a more ergonomic keyboard
        named the alice style keyboard</p>
      <img src="robeats/rb-2.4.png" width="490" height="250">
      <p class="middle-text">Additionally, when looking at my research on controllers the Synths lab solo Macropad, one
        of its disadvantages is that since its small the distance between the buttons are small too, making it more
        crammed and harder to see where your pressing and making your hands feel uncomfortable</p>
      <p class="middle-text"></p>

      <h1>Rubber Feet</h1>
      <img src="robeats/rb-3.1.png" width="730" height="240">
      <p class="middle-text">When playing with a controller, most of the time it tends to slip away easily when the
        player is too focused on the game, especially for rhythm game players who mostly focus on the screen, they may
        not realize their controller is sliping away and when pressing on where they thought the button was, they
        realize the controller has slid away, causing them to lose their focus, combo, and score in the game.</p>

      <p class="middle-text"> Additionally since looking at my research on controllers, this was also an advantage point
        from the Pocket SDVX Pico v5.</p>

      <h1>Making The Buttons Big</h1>
      <img src="robeats/rb-4.jpg" width="290" height="260">
      <p class="middle-text">
        The buttons have a radius of 3.5cm and a diameter of 7cm, the area of the circle is 38.5cm²
      </p>
      <p class="middle-text">
        I decided on larger buttons to enhance visual clarity for the controller. This improves players' ability to
        identify buttons quickly during fast-paced gameplay, increasing precision and accuracy. Compared to smaller
        keyboard keys, the larger buttons offer a larger surface area, making them easier to see and press accurately.
      </p>

      <p class="middle-text">

        The larger buttons make the game more accessible to a wider audience as layers with different dexterity levels
        or larger hands may struggle or experience discomfort with smaller buttons. The increased target size of the
        larger buttons provides a solution, making the game more inclusive and accommodating for those who have
        difficulty with smaller buttons.
      </p>
      <p class="middle-text">Additionally like stated earlier during my point about widening the distance within
        buttons, the wider surface area allows players to distribute the force across a larger portion of their fingers,
        minimizing the strain on specific joints or muscles. </p>

      <h1>User Journey</h1>
      <img src="robeats/rb-uj.png" width="560" height="490">

      <h1>Final Product</h1>
      <img src="robeats/rb-5.1.png" width="590" height="200">
      <p class="middle-text">The overall product looked like this</p>

      <img src="robeats/rb-5.2.png" width="290" height="180">
      <p class="middle-text">There is an aluminium inside of the controller, where it can be adjusted to any size of
        finge making it more accessable for those with smaller or larger fingers. </p>

      <img src="robeats/rb-5.3.png" width="590" height="460">
      <p class="middle-text">The front has the robeats logo, layers with white so it pops out more visually, and on the
        side dj Miku implying that the controller is from him as stated earlier</p>

      <img src="robeats/rb-5.4.png" width="610" height="230">
      <p class="middle-text">This is the output hole ( I used the roblox font for this text since robeats is a game on
        the roblox platform )</p>

      <img src="robeats/rb-3.1.png" width="730" height="240">
      <p class="middle-text">As shown earlier the rubber feet.</p>

      <h1>Manual</h1>
      <img src="robeats/rb-m1.jpg" width="300" height="410">
      <img src="robeats/rb-m2.jpg" width="300" height="410">
      <p class="middle-text">I decided to make the manual look like a set list to fit the dj theme, and to write the
        words as if DJ Miku ( the dj character in the game ) wrote this set list and is teaching the user how to start
        up the controller, in a set list of instructions. ( set lists are usually written down in pencil or pen on a
        piece of paper or use similar font to the one I chose, examples can be seen below) </p>
