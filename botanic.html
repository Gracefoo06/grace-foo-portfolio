      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h2>What is Botanic Gardens AR?</h2>
      <p class="middle-text">Botanic Gardens AR is an mobile AR game based on Botanic Gardens Singapore. We aimed to
        bring
        an educational and unique approach to teaching users about the nature, and history of the Gardens.
        This uses multiple interactions, which unlocks a secret area when completed. The interactions start from the
        virtual 3D map, tapping on small plants to see clues, playing through hedge mazes and learning how to recycle.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p class="middle-text">Botanic Gardens AR is an mobile AR game based on Botanic Gardens Singapore, exclusive to
        Andrioid. We aim to bring
        an educational and unique approach to educating users about the flora and fauna, and history of the Gardens.
        This uses multiple interactions, which unlocks a secret area when completed. The interactions start from the
        virtual 3D map, tapping on small plants to see clues, playing through hedge mazes and learning how to keep the
        environment clean and safe for all.
      <p class="middle-text">This app is made for Android mobile phones, using android version 10.0 ( API level 29 ). If

      <p class="middle-text">For our app, players can create accounts, sign in, submit scores and submit images through
        firebase.

        On our main website, players can log in, view their position on the leaderboard, vote for their favourite mini
        games, talk to other plays on the message board, contact us and join our news letter.

      <img src="botanic/bt-compeititive1.png" width="970" height="400">
      <p class="middle-text">We performed a competitive analysis of games similar to what we had in mind, we did a
        competitive analysis of Magical Forest, Wildeverse, WWF forest and Planet Stories AR, which can all be seen in
        detail in the full proposal
      </p>
      <h2>Table of Summary of our findings( the full table can be seen in the proposal )</h2>

      <h1>Persona</h1>
      <img src="botanic/bt-persona.png" width="620" height="460">
      <p class="middle-text">Shao Min, who is an 18-year-old NAFA student, is my persona and usability tester. She's
        enjoys games who also loves nature and animals, and she's interested in new technology like AR. However, being
        red-green color blind, she faces challenges with certain games that aren't inclusive of her disability, makes it
        more difficult to play certain games. Shao Min's interests align with our target audience, thus, her feedback
        will be valuable.</p>

      <h1>Game Design Segment (full Game Design Segment in Proposal)</h1>
      <h2>Game Overview</h2>
      <p class="middle-text">Players first register and or log in, and they will be sent into the main menu scene, where
        they can either start playing the game, adjust audio, take a picture competition, check our website, and can log
        out. </p>

      <p class="middle-text">When starting the game, the player will be introduced to Botanic Gardens and how the game
        will work and the different image targets, and that they can unlock the greenhouse when finishing all 4 areas.
      </p>

      <p class="middle-text">They can scan through each of the images to play interactions for each area, such as the
        fusion area, the recycling area, maze and the quiz.</p>

      <p class="middle-text">Once playing through all of them, they will be notified that they can scan and play the
        greenhouse area. Once done visiting the area they van go back to the main menu and log out</p>

      <h2>MVP (Minimum Viable Product </h2>
      <ul class="middle-text">
        <li>Player log in and sign up</li>
        <li>Toggle on and off button UI button</li>
        <li>A "?" button</li>
        <li>A mix of ground plane high ground</li>

        <li>Making sure that when all base interactions work, they can unlock the greenhouse</li>
        <li>Using a camera animation to give a tour on the greenhouse</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>WishList</h2>
      <p class="middle-text">This is what I wished to have in our project if we had more time</p>
      <ul class="middle-text">
        <li>Player log in and sign up</li>
        <li>Toggle on and off button UI button</li>
        <li>A "?" button</li>
        <li>A mix of ground plane high ground</li>
        <li>Making sure all our base interactions can work, no hidden secrets to tap on</li>

        <li>Making sure that when all base interactions work, they can unlock the greenhouse</li>
        <li>Using a camera animation to give a tour on the greenhouse</li>
        <li>The player can turn the camera in any direction during the greenhouse scene</li>
        <li>The player can tour the greenhouse through AR</li>
        <li>An option for a voice to play, which narrates the text shown on the screen</li>
        <li>Being able to animate all the UI panels shown on the screen for consistency</li>
        <li>Photo taking for the Gazebo decorating minigame</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Things to note before designing for mobile apps</h1>
      <p class="middle-text">I did research on designing for mobile apps before figuring out the layout of the UI or
        anything else, so I can optimize it best for players.</p>
      <img src="botanic/bt-mobile.png" width="650" height="400">
      <h1>Things to note when making UI for those who are color blind</h1>
      <p class="middle-text">I did research on making UI for those who are colorblind, since because colors are very
        important in conveying a message when it comes to UI/UX design, however there are 300 million people in the
        world (8% of the worlds population are color blind ) (ClintonEye, n.d.). If we do not keep colorblindness in
        mind when designing, we could loose out 300million people from playing our app, due to having difficulties not
        being able to see things cleary or accurately and will lead to motivating less people in visiting Botanic
        Gardens, which is our target goal.
        Thus when I designed the UI, we must make sure that the methods and colors used, do not limit people with color
        blindness from being able to play our game.
      </p>
      <img src="botanic/bt-blind1.png" width="670" height="410">
      <h1>Design Rationale</h1>
      <p class="middle-text">Here is where I explain my design rationale for the font chosen, which was to make it
        easier to read for those with Visual Imparements</p>
      <img src="botanic/bt-rationale.png" width="620" height="350">
      <p class="middle-text">Here is where I explain my design rationale for the prompters, since players may be
        confused easily since some may be unfamiliar with game apps or AR technology, it is here to help them so they
        dont feel too lost.</p>
      <img src="botanic/bt-rationale1.png" width="660" height="350">
      <p class="middle-text">Here is where I explain my design rationale for the UI design used. Since colorblind people
        can see the difference in terms of darkness or lightness of a color they can use it to diffierciate things, thus
        I used dark green with a white border to see things easier</p>
      <img src="botanic/bt-rationale2.png" width="690" height="430">
      <p class="middle-text">To read the screenshots in higher quality in and or more detailed design rationales, it can
        be read in the full proposal</p>

      <h1>Features</h1>


      <h2>3D map</h2>
      <img src="botanic/bt-map.png" width="350" height="350">
      <p class="middle-text">The map shows a miniature map of Botanic Gardens in our AR game. It can play music,
        animations and scale up and down</p>

      <h2>Fusion Game</h2>
      <img src="botanic/bt-quiz.png">
      <p class="middle-text">The fusion game is a bit like a puzzle, where players have to drag parts of the Botanic
        Garden's Bandstand, which is one of its most iconic land mark, and drag it in the middle to fuse it to complete
        building it. Players then can decorate it after finishing it.</p>

      <h2>Learning Forest</h2>
      <img src="botanic/bt-forest.jpg">
      <p class="middle-text">The learning forest is a quiz based game where players drag the learning stick to a model
        to pick the right option. If they get questions right, more models will pop up on the learning forest, where if
        you tap it, it plays animation.</p>

      <h2>Maze</h2>
      <img src="botanic/bt-maze.png">
      <p class="middle-text">You have to guide the monkey out of the 3 mazes in the time constraint. Your final score
        will then be sent into the database and to be seen in the website's leaderboard.</p>

      <h2>Recycling and collecting</h2>
      <img src="botanic/bt-clean.png">
      <p class="middle-text">Players have to collect trash and learn to recycle them in the correct recycling bin.</p>

      <h2>Glasshouse Visit</h2>
      <IMG SRC="botanic/bt-glass.gif">
      <p class="middle-text">Once players finish all 4 main areas, they get access to the glassshouse where they can
        walk around this enviroment using their fingers to explore and appreciate this exclusive area</p>

      <h2>Picture competition</h2>
      <IMG SRC="botanic/bt-cam.png">
      <p class="middle-text">Players could take a selfie at Botanic Gardens and stand to win a chance to get a prize if
        they submit a picture, which will be sent into our firebase database.</p>
