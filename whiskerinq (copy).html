        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>What is Whiskered Inquiry?</h2>
        <p class="middle-text">Whiskred Inquiry is a first person visual novel, mystery adventure game, where you the
          player have to gather evidence and defend your your best friend and client, Buddy, at court, who was framed
          for murder of his ex-partner, Sunshine. Whiskred Inquiry is meant to be a game made for compueters to play.
        </p>
        <p>‎ </p>
        <p class="middle-text">To promote the main game, we proposed the idea of an easy and accessible Spin-Off App to
          show the art from the original game and to promote the characters of the game, so they would enjoy the app and
          would try the original game after playing it for a while. The full Proposal in detail can be seen through the
          buttons on the left, or you can click <a href="wi/WhiskinqPDF.pdf">"here"</a>. We even made a prototype
          version of it which can be accessed on the buttons on the left, or you can click <a
            href="wi/whiskeredinqXD.xd">"here"</a>. </p>


        <h2>What is Whiskered Inquiry – trials and debates ( WITD )?</h2>
        <p class="middle-text">Whiskered inquiry – trials and debates ( WITD) is a spin off game of our main game called
          Whiskered inquiry. In WITD, you can create an account and log in, for daily rewards, tasks, gacha ( “Gacha
          games are games that tempt you into spending real-world money in return for random rewards, which will vary in
          both quality and worth.” ) (Randell, 2023),the main debate feature, which is a turn based, where you can
          debate others with the correct card type, the lesser turns and time taken, will lead to a higher score on the
          leader board, and which it will refresh and reward players for their scores.</p>
        <h2>Core Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A user who can collect a bunch of cards with cute art of cats</li>
          <li>A user who can enjoy a simple turn-based game</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <img src="wi/wi-ap.png" width="830" height="470">
        <p class="middle-text"> We performed competitive analysis towards 3 games which are similar to a final app we
          have in mind, the three games are Tears Of Themis, Fate Grand Order ( FGO ), and Touhou Lost World, to learn
          the advantages and disadvantages of them so we could potentially apply it to our final app, which can all be
          seen in more detail in the document</p>
